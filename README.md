# M5StackXmicro-bit
Example alpha test code for the M5:Bit

Here you will find the necessary files to run the demo shown
in the new product intro for June video on youtube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdN3xEi0uqY&t=25s

Connect your microbit up to the computer and drop the hex file on its usb drive

Use ampy, rshell or some other file transfer method to get the .py file on to your
M5Stack. Or you could directly copy and paste the .py files contents into the python
page on flow.m5stack.com

Once you have prepared both devices connect the finger scanner to port B and the M5:Bit
to port C of your M5Stack device. Load the python file and then insert your microbit
into the slot on the M5:Bit
